        <p>Galien can be found in Deepnest, close to the Failed Tramway.</p>

        <h2>Lore:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Galien trained in the wilds outside of Hallownest, hoping to become a knight. He became known for his
            strength, being undefeated in battle and claimed to be the strongest warrior in Hallownest. He desired to
            prove his strength to The Pale King and came to Deepnest to test his valor and prove himself. However, the
            creatures in Deepnest proved too strong and killed him. When talking to the Knight, he is under the
            impression he is still alive, thinking his dead husk was some poor fool.</p>
        <h2>Battle:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><span>Health:</span></p>
        <p>230/368/479/570/640 <br>
            Scaling with Nail Upgrades 0/1/2/3/4 respectively.</p>
        <p><span>Moves:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Spinning Scythe: Galien will spawn a single scythe that will spin repeatedly. It will then bounce up and
                down the arena dealing 1 mask of damage to the Knight. After some time, the Scythe will stop spinning,
                being stationary in the air. It will then start spinning again and be hurled right towards the Knight.
            </li>
            <li>Dream Scythes: similar to Spinning Scythe, but much smaller. 2 of these spawn in total, the first when
                Galien reaches 70% HP and the second at 40%. They will also rebound and ricochet around the area like
                the Spinning Scythe. Also deals 1 mask of damage.</li>
