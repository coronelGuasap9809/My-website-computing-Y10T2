        <h2>Lore:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Gorb was a mystic creature with an enlarged brain, titled “Gorb, The Great Mind” by his followers, and
            claimed to be All-Knowing. He goaded other bugs into following him, revering his mind, and convince them to
            “ascend” to a higher plane of existence. His body as well as the bodies of his followers were places atop a
            hill in the Howling Peaks, with a tombstone depicting Gorb's image.</p>
        <h2>Battle:</h2>

            Scaling with Nail Upgrades 0/1/2/3/4 respectively.</p>
        <p><span>Moves:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Spear Cast: 8 spears spawn around Gorb in a ring and then fire off in a circle, dealing 1 mask of
                damage. This is
                Gorb's main attack. At 70% HP, Gorb will fire 2 waves of spears each attack, and 3 at 40%. The placement
                of the spears in
                the ring change slightly when there are multiple waves.</li>
            <li>Directed Spear: Gorb summons a single spear and launches it directly towards the Knight, dealing 1 mask
                of damage. This
                attack is repeated, a spear launching every 1-2 seconds.</li>
            <li>Teleport: Gorb will randomly teleport around the arena.</li>
        </ul>
