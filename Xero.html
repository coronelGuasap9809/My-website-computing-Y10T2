        <p>Xero can be found in the lower part of the Resting Grounds, to the left of the Dreamer Statues.</p>

        <h2>Lore:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Xero was a strong and proud warrior of Hallownest who believed strength would allow him hope, freedom and
            anything else he wanted. In his dreams, he would "cut that plague with his nails", most likely meaning he
            was able to fight off the infection and the light when he was dreaming, however he was still infected. Xero
            believed that he could fight against the infection with violence and his strength. Fueled by these ideas, he
            turned his weapons against Hallownest and the Pale King, which ultimately ended in his execution. His body,
            along with other traitors of the king, were placed in the Resting Grounds, their tombs a warning to anyone
            who would want to betray the Pale King. When the Knight talks to Xero, he is still under the impression that
            his actions were right and justifiable, and blamed his demise on cruel fate, and saying all those who hope
            against the infection are doomed to the same fate as him. After being defeated, Xero realises what he did
            wrong. He asks the knight not to call him a traitor, simply to call him a fool, and that wherever the Knight
            goes, he will be watching. </p>

        <p><span>Health:</span></p>
        <p>200/320/416/500/570 <br>
            Scaling with Nail Upgrades 0/1/2/3/4 respectively.</p>
        <p><span>Moves:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Nail Cast: Xero summons 2 magic nails at his left and right sides. While moving around the arena, he
                will fling one of his nails towards the Knight, before drawing it back and then firing the other one.
                This is Xero's one and only attack, but he uses it constantly. If the Knight comes into contact with the
                nails at any time, they will take 1 mask of damage. Xero fires a nail every 1-2 seconds, but at half
                health the nails increase from 2 to 4, and he fires them every 0.75 seconds.</li>
