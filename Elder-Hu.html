        <h2>Lore:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Elder Hu was from outside Hallownest who came to the kingdom to use his abilities as a traveling sage and
            warrior to rid Hallownest of the infection. He went into the Fungal Wastes and made his way to Mantis
            Village where he encountered the mantises and the Mantis Lords. He believed that they were infected and
            attacked. However, they were much stronger and killed him. If the Knight talks to Elder Hu after defeating
            him,
            he realises that the mantises weren't infected and says that they were right to kill him.</p>

                immediately. Each time slams down, another pair appears, closer to the left/right until the rings meet
                in the center of the arena, dealing 1 mask of damage.</li>
            <li>Teleport: Elder Hu will teleport randomly around the arena</li>
